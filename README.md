[00:26.92] Back in black
[00:28.40] I hit the sack
[00:29.62] I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
[00:32.03] Yes, I'm let loose
[00:33.76] From the noose
[00:35.26] That's kept me hanging about
[00:37.05] I've been looking at the sky
[00:38.56] 'Cause it's gettin' me high
[00:40.28] Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
[00:42.33] I got nine lives
[00:44.35] Cat's eyes
[00:45.28] Abusin' every one of them and running wild
[00:47.31] 'Cause I'm back
[00:49.85] Yes, I'm back
[00:52.32] Well, I'm back
[00:54.92] Yes, I'm back
[00:57.56] Well, I'm back, back
[01:02.76] Well, I'm back in black
[01:05.03] Yes, I'm back in black
[01:08.19] Back in the back
[01:09.17] Of a Cadillac
[01:10.48] Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
[01:12.99] Yes, I'm in a bang
[01:14.75] With a gang
[01:16.20] They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
[01:18.10] 'Cause I'm back on the track
[01:19.61] And I'm beatin' the flack
[01:20.90] Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
[01:23.41] So look at me now
[01:24.81] I'm just makin' my play
[01:26.19] Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
[01:28.45] 'Cause I'm back
[01:30.69] Yes, I'm back
[01:33.55] Well, I'm back
[01:36.08] Yes, I'm back
[01:38.47] Well, I'm back, back
[01:43.62] Well, I'm back in black
[01:46.11] Yes, I'm back in black
[02:29.51] Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back
[02:34.47] Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back
[02:39.36] Well, I'm back, back
[02:44.64] Well, I'm back in black
[02:47.10] Yes, I'm back in black
[02:52.87] Oh, yeah
[02:54.50] Oh, yeah
[02:57.05] Take my love
[02:59.45] Oh, yeah, yeah
[03:04.94] Oh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
[03:09.29] Well, I'm back (I'm back)
[03:12.84] Back (I'm back)
[03:15.52] Back (I'm back)
[03:18.01] Back (I'm back)
[03:20.37] Back (I'm back)
[03:23.05] Back
[03:25.05] Back in black
[03:27.02] Yes, I'm back in black
[03:33.35] I've hit the sack
