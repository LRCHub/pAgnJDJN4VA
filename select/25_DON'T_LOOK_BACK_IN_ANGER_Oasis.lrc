[00:12.27] Slip inside the eye of your mind
[00:16.26] Don't you know you might find
[00:19.87] A better place to play?
[00:23.77] You said that you'd never been
[00:28.13] But all the things that you've seen
[00:31.60] Will slowly fade away
[00:42.10] 
[00:36.13] So I start a revolution from my bed
[00:41.60] 'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
[00:47.52] Step outside, summertime's in bloom
[00:53.43] Stand up beside the fireplace
[00:56.34] Take that look from off your face
[00:59.64] You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
[01:18.64] 
[01:11.21] And so Sally can wait
[01:15.26] She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
[01:22.88] Her soul slides away
[01:27.96] "But don't look back in anger", I heard you say
[01:51.46] 
[01:44.29] Take me to the place where you go
[01:48.07] Where nobody knows if it's night or day
[01:55.65] Please don't put your life in the hands
[01:59.88] Of a rock n' roll band who'll throw it all away
[02:23.38] 
[02:07.84] Gonna start a revolution from my bed
[02:13.22] 'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
[02:19.02] Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
[02:25.28] Stand up beside the fireplace
[02:27.18] Take that look from off your face
[02:30.04] 'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
[02:52.54] 
[02:41.56] And so Sally can wait
[02:45.65] She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
[02:53.34] My soul slides away
[02:58.50] "But don't look back in anger", I heard you say
[03:22.00] 
[03:05.36] So Sally can wait
[03:44.31] She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
[03:51.97] Her soul slides away
[03:56.93] "But don't look back in anger", I heard you say
[04:20.43] 
[04:04.08] So Sally can wait
[04:08.41] She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
[04:16.44] My soul slides away
[04:21.82] "But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"
[04:28.51] I heard you say
[04:36.01] 
[04:40.46] At least not today
