Oh, yeah
Hello Donnington
How you doin'?
You guys are great
We've got some back in black for you, ready

Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose, from the noose
That's kept me hanging about

I've been lookin' at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and runnin' wild

'Cause I'm back
Yes I'm back
Uh, I'm back, mama
Yes, I'm back
Uh, well I'm back, back, mama
Back in black
Well I'm back in black

Back in a back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet
I'm a power pack
I'm in a band, with a gang
They've got to catch me if you want me to hang

Well I'm back on the track, beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now, I'm just makin' my play
Push your luck, get out of my way

'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Uh, I'm back, mama
Yes, I'm back
Uh, I'm back, back, mama
Back in black
Well I'm back in black, come-on

Back, back, back, mama
Back, mama 'cause I'm back
Back, mama, back in black
Well I'm back in black

Yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yes, I'm back, I'm back
I'm back, mama, I'm back, mama
'Cause I'm back, I'm back, mama
Back in black
Well I'm back in black
